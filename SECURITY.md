# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Safety

Survival Pending is a platform for LGBTQ+ individuals to share their stories anonymously during critical times. Given the sensitive nature of our platform and the vulnerability of our users, security is not just a technical concernâ€”it's a moral imperative. We are committed to maintaining the highest security standards to protect our users' identities, stories, and safety.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### DO NOT CREATE PUBLIC ISSUES

**IMPORTANT**: Never create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure could:
- Expose our users to immediate danger
- Allow malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities
- Compromise the anonymity of story contributors
- Put vulnerable individuals at risk

### How to Report Using GitHub Security Advisories

We use GitHub's private Security Advisory feature to manage vulnerability reports securely.

#### Step-by-Step Reporting Process

1. **Navigate to Security Tab**: Go to https://github.com/parenthetical-dev/survivalpending/security
2. **Click "Report a vulnerability"**: This opens a private security advisory
3. **Fill in the Advisory Form**:
   - **Title**: Brief description of the vulnerability
   - **CVE ID**: Leave blank (we'll request one if needed)
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation including:
     - Type of vulnerability
     - Potential impact on users
     - Affected components/files
   - **Severity**: Select appropriate level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - **Proof of Concept**: Include code samples or reproduction steps
   - **Recommended Fix**: Your suggestions if any

#### Benefits of GitHub Security Advisories

- **Private Discussion**: Invisible to public until resolved
- **Secure Collaboration**: Work directly with maintainers
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Manage timeline together
- **Credit Attribution**: Proper recognition for researchers
- **CVE Assignment**: Official vulnerability tracking if needed
- **Automated Patches**: GitHub can create security updates

#### What Happens Next

1. **Immediate Notification**: Maintainers are alerted instantly
2. **Private Fork**: GitHub creates a private fork for developing fixes
3. **Collaboration**: We work together in the private advisory
4. **Patch Development**: Fix is developed and tested privately
5. **Coordinated Release**: Security update and advisory published together

## Security Measures in Place

### User Protection
- **No Email Collection**: We never collect email addresses
- **Anonymous Authentication**: Auto-generated usernames only
- **No Recovery Options**: Protects against social engineering
- **No Personal Data**: We don't store identifying information
- **Auto-deletion**: Stories can be set to auto-delete

### Technical Safeguards
- **End-to-End Encryption**: For sensitive data transmission
- **Secure Token Management**: JWT with short expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Input Validation**: Prevention of injection attacks
- **Content Security Policy**: XSS protection
- **HTTPS Only**: All connections encrypted

### Operational Security
- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly assessments
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures
- **Data Minimization**: We only store what's necessary

## Quick Exit Feature

The platform includes a quick exit feature (3x ESC or panic button) that:
- Immediately closes the browser tab
- Clears local storage
- Redirects to a benign website
- Leaves no browser history

## Special Considerations

### Location Security
- No IP logging beyond what's required for security
- No geolocation features
- VPN/Tor friendly

### Content Moderation
- Automated scanning for self-harm content
- Immediate crisis intervention resources
- Human review with trauma-informed moderators

### Law Enforcement Requests
- We will resist requests to the fullest extent legally possible
- Users will be notified unless legally prohibited
- Transparency reports published quarterly

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Use a VPN or Tor**: For additional anonymity
2. **Private Browsing**: Use incognito/private mode
3. **Secure Device**: Ensure your device is not compromised
4. **Save Credentials Securely**: Use a password manager
5. **Don't Share Usernames**: Keep your identity private

## Bug Bounty Program

[Coming Soon] We plan to launch a bug bounty program to reward security researchers who help us protect our users.

## Contact

- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub Security Advisories (see above)
- **General Support**: GitHub Discussions or Issues (non-security)
- **Crisis Support**: Links available on platform

## Acknowledgments

We maintain a hall of fame for security researchers who have helped improve our platform's security. With your permission, we'll add your name/handle here after a vulnerability is resolved.
